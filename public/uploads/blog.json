But it is only possible when you drink pure and healthy water all the time you wish to drink water. These days all almost all the source of water is heavily contaminated, and it is because of the industrialization and various human activity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drinking of contaminated water leads to various kinds of health issues and waterborne diseases. Thus it is always advisable to treat your drinking water before you consume it. Being natural solvent water can dissolve almost everything in it due to this feature water has become home of the various kinds of disease-causing agents, and consumption of this form of water may lead to fatal health conditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Four Methods Of Water Purification<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With the water purification system's help, water can be adequately treated, and all kinds of contamination can be eliminated easily. There are various water purification methods, but here we have listed the top four methods to purify water and these methods are <\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Coagulation & Flocculation<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Disinfection<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Distillation <\/li>\r\n\t<li>Filtration<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Coagulation & Flocculation<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the first step of the water purification process in which some chemicals are added to the water for the removal of the suspended particle from the water. These added particles can be organic and inorganic. The added inorganic compound can neutralize the negatively charged particle present in water, and after neutralization, these particles start forming metal hydroxide of aluminum ions and iron.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These metal ions combine and form large compounds by the induced flocculation process. After forming abundant compounds, it starts absorbing suspended particles present in water and induced removal of those suspended particles by a process called filtration and sedimentation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Disinfection<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The cleaning process, which is used to destroy microbes present in water, is called as disinfection. This can be achieved by removing or by adding disinfectant chemicals. It can be made with the help of chlorine, chlorine dioxide, chloramine, ozone, and ultra-violate (UV) rays.  Chlorine and its compounds (chlorine dioxide and chloramine) are potent oxidants that effectively kill the microbes present in the water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ozone used in the disinfection process is also a powder oxidant. Ozone is unstable molecules that produce natation oxygen, and oxygen is the powerful oxidizing agent. UV rays have high penetration power, which can destroy all kinds of microbial contamination present in water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Distillation<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The distillation process is defined as the separation of something from the liquid mixture through selective boiling and condensation. With the distillation process, both particle and complete separation of the unwanted material from the water molecules can be done. In the distillation, process water is subjected to heat. Thus various Scientist believes that the distillation process is one of the best process among all the water purification process.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boiling point of the water is less as compared to the various water pollutants and disease-causing agents. Thus water gets vaporized, leaving the impurities after the vaporization water is directed to the condenser to cool. After the cooling vapor converted into water. The water obtained in the Distillation process are entirely free from all kind of water contamination.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Filtration<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a mechanical process used to separate solids from the fluids by adding a medium that only allows the fluids to pass through it. The fluids which pass through are called the filtrate. It is one of the active water purification processes among all the processes. A filtration process can be done by both physical and chemical means. This process ensures that your drinking water is entirely free from contamination.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Few Other Methods For Water Purification<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>#1. Distillation<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Distillation is a water purification technology that uses heat to purify water in the form of vapors. This method is effective as water has a lower boiling point than other suspended contaminants and disease-causing agents inside water. Water is connected to a heat source until it reaches its boiling point and left until it vaporizes completely and is directed into a condenser to cool. After cooling, water vapor turns into water that is clean and safe for drinking. The other substances present in the water are left alone in the container because of their higher boiling point.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distillation method effectively rejects bacteria, germs, excess salts, and other heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic. Distillation is an ideal technique for people who have access to raw and surface water. This method has both pros and cons as it has a slow process of water purification and needs a heat source for the purification to work. However, some other sources of energy are also developed, as distillation is always a costly method of purifying water. It is only effective and least costly when purifying a small amount of water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#2. Chlorination<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Chlorine is an effective chemical that has been used in water purification for many years to make it ready for consumption. Chlorination is an effective water purification technique that kills germs, parasites, and other disease-causing microbes found in groundwater. Water can be effectively purified by using chlorine tablets or liquid chlorine. As a non-machinery water purification method, chlorine is cheap and effective in all other methods.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, precautionary measures should be taken when using chlorine to treat the bulk amount of drinking water. People suffering from thyroid problems should talk to a medical practitioner before consuming chlorinated water. When using chlorine, it is suggested to apply them in boiled water, as they dissolve properly in water above 21 degree Celsius or more. Chlorine tablets will effectively kill the entire suspended bacteria and make your water unsafe.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for the best and cost-effective ways of treating your water, chlorine is your best chemical to use in place of water purification methods and has become the most used water purification method. Apart from chlorination, reverse osmosis is the best option, whereas filtering is good for basic water filtration after sediment and chlorine purifications. Reverse osmosis and UV technology cover a number of houses where water needs to be treated before drinking.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#3. Boiling<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Boiling water is the cheap and easy method of water purification that has been used since ancient times. Water sources or municipal distribution of water may be unsafe for drinking as parasites and germs are the things that you can't see with your bare eyes, but their effects can make you worried.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the boiling method, clean water should be brought to boil and left at least 2-3 minutes at the same flame. It is recommended to boil water slightly for a longer duration in higher altitude areas as compared to the lower altitudes. Boiled water should be covered properly after boiling and left to cool completely. For water drawn from wells, leave for a few minutes to settle sediments before you filter out or boil for drinking.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Which Water Purification System Is Best To Use In The Home?<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A water purifier system is the best way to get rid of both the large and microscopic particles that can pollute water on a larger scale. A balanced water purification system can be highly effective when a combination of a pre-filter, secondary filter, and post-filter is used together. A pre-filter is used to get rid of the larger particles of sediment and improve the taste of water by getting rid of the smell of chlorine. An activated carbon filter stops impurities present in the water before it passes onto the next filter.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, a reverse osmosis filter is used as a secondary water filter that pushes water through a semipermeable membrane and catches as small as 0.0001 microns of particles like bacteria and viruses. During the post-filter stage, the final destruction of impurities is given, usually with UV light or a sub-micron filter that catches as small as 0.035-micron particles. So, it is said that a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/water-purifier-service\">water purifier<\/a> is the ultimate solution for all kinds of water impurities, whether it is microbial or chemical.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"marker\">About The Author<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"marker\">Abhishek Kumar<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"marker\">M.tech (Biotechnology)<\/span><\/span><\/h3>","blog_image":"HX8bali10.jpg","blog_image_cover":null,"blog_date":null,"update_time":"2025-04-07 14:57:14","status":"active","updated_at":"2025-04-07","created_at":"2020-07-06","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2020-07-06"},

Expert suggests one should get their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/water-purifier-service\">water purifier service<\/a> within every 3 months. However, this period depends upon the concentration of the contaminant present in the water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you read right. It is the concentration of water contaminant that affects the efficiency of the device and disturbs the water purifier filters. Although the water purifier filters have their own lifespan but regularly encountering a high concentration of water pollutants the filter gets muddy and clogged, resulting in compromised purified water quality and low output water flow.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Let&rsquo;s start discussing signs that a water purifier shows demand for services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sign That Indicates Need For Water Purifier Services<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Low Water Yield<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually your purifier would release enough water to fill the glass, but sometimes it only fills half the glass and stops the flow of water from the tap. If you are experience this then there is any trouble in the water filter. This is because your water inlet has a higher or lower percentage of water. An RO requires at least 40 to 60 psi of water pressure to function correctly. There may also be a fault in the water filter. Try to provide a constant water supply to the water inlet because it can also diminish the performance of the water filter. In case of low or no yield of pure water supply, find the nearest water purifier service center to check the condition of the filter.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A damaged RO layer can also be a cause of low water yield. The semipermeable membrane (the barrier that allows only some molecules to pass, blocking the path of other molecules) removes small particles and microorganisms from the water. When the membrane rises, the water filtration process slows down, and the water quality decreases. If the membrane is clogged or damaged, it should be replaced to prevent severe health problems. Also, note that the RO layer needs to be changed once a year or every two years, depending on the usage. This ensures clean and healthy drinking water on a daily basis.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Making strange or unpleasant sound<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may hear a strange noise coming from the faucet that drains water from the water purifier tank. In this situation, there is no need to change the water purifier just find an expert RO technician to check the disturbance. This occurs when air is pushed outside the system or due to a change in the water pressure in the system. As soon as the filter is replaced, if the noise does not subside, call a professional to check that the pipes are properly installed. Noise also occurs if the storage valve is not closed correctly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/how-water-purifier-service-can-help-you-improve-your-health\">How Water Purifier Service Can Help You Improve Your Health<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>If there is continuous leakage from the water purifier tap, a part of the purifier may become damaged due to some breakage. To fix the problem, the part must be tightened or replaced. If the same problem appears in the filter membrane, it may be due to a damaged inlet. Call a RO professional to check if the RO is appropriately closed. Also, check the O-rings and replace them if they are torn or not in good condition and keep them tight.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Water Inlet Problem Or Low Water Pressure<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some common problems caused by low water pressure. As they said, an RO requires at least 40 to 60 pounds per square inch of pressure to function properly. If the water pressure is less than 40 psi, you should increase the strength. This can be done with the help of a commonly used water pump for RO water purifiers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. The Bad Taste Of Weird Odor<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes you experience an unpleasant odor in water, which can result from improper working for water purifier filters. This is the most vital sign that your water purifier demands for immediate servicing, so contact the nearest service store and get your water purifier service done.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Abnormal TDS Level In The Water<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Various officials have set the TDS level in the water, and water having low TDS is considered safe (but ensure your water TDS level is not less than 50mg\/liter). You can quickly check your water TDS level with a digital TDS meter. If your drink water TDS is higher than the normal TDS level, then it indicates to change the water filter immediately.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some Other Reasons For Getting Water Purifier Servicing<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>#1. A Water Purifier Runs Without Stopping<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This happens when the on-off valve doesn&#39;t work properly, or the valve is broken. To stop the continuous flow of water, you must measure the pressure in the storage tank. The ideal pressure is around 35-40 psi as higher than the normal cause of valve breakage. If the check valve is broken for any reason then consider&nbsp;replacing it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#2. Water Appears Cloudy After Purification<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pure water appears colorless and transparent, as any such cloudiness in the water means there are some impurities present in it. If water lacks the quality that means the filter doesn&#39;t work as they&#39;re supposed to. Cloudy water is not considered safe for drinking and other household purposes. Turbidity denotes the cloudiness of the water, as you can check for it by holding a full glass of water against the sunlight. If the water appears cloudy even after purification, it is a clear sign that you need water purifier service.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#3. Never Ignore Drips And Leakages In A Water Purifier<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are experiencing a leak in your water purifier, don&#39;t neglect it at any cost, and get in touch with a verified technician to schedule a maintenance check-up as soon as possible. Make sure that the necessary steps are taken on time until the leak is sealed with non-plastic tape. Any such leakage may appear due to loose pipelines, improper handling, and others. You can get a lower water yield than normal and higher wastage when these leakages can&#39;t be resolved quickly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/5-benefits-of-regular-water-purifier-servicing\">5 Benefits Of Regular Water Purifier Servicing<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>Conclusion<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is essential to do some water quality checks to assure clean and clear water. It is also necessary to check the water purifier regularly to ensure its efficiency &amp; productivity. Being a crucial home appliance, it needs on-time service and maintenance. So, find the nearest water purifier service center with multi-skilled water purifier service engineers to tackle any hassles.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"marker\">For More Assistance contact Professional water purifier service provider @7065012902<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<h3>About Author<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Basant Kumar&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>M.Tech (Biotechnology)<\/h3>","blog_image":"YDfsiMmannubhai blog_banner.webp","blog_image_cover":null,"blog_date":null,"update_time":"2022-01-28 15:46:24","status":"active","updated_at":"2022-01-28","created_at":"2020-07-17","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2020-07-17"},

To hire skilled and completely trained professional plumbers call @7065012902.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<h2>5 Common Plumbing Issues<\/h2>\n\n<h3>1. Dripping Faucets<\/h3>\n\n<p>Dripping faucets are such a common plumbing problem in all plumbing-related complications. The faucet is annoying, useless, and expensive when it becomes ill. Sometimes, but in some cases, these drops can be caused by washers or rings, which can be easily replaced. In other instances, corrosion or improper tap installation can cause dripping problems. Try to calculate the dripping problems and their expense because it will make your pocket empty. So, try to connect with an expert plumbing solution to diagnose the problem and make it long-lasting quickly.<\/p>\n\n<h3>2. Clogged Bath Or Shower Drain<\/h3>\n\n<p>Health hazards and even plumbing disasters can come if drainage problems are not resolved quickly. A slow or clogged drain in the house usually means that the problem is localized to that area of the house typically, these sewers are closed because of hair, soap and other foreign objects build up in the gutter over time. Routine drain cleaning is the ideal solution to this problem. Multiple slow or clogged drains are on the plan, which can help you fix sewer line problems. To prevent sewage backup in your home, whenever you see pipes in your home too slowly, this is called a lane the plumber, especially if the problem starts with tubes in the lowest areas of your home.<\/p>\n\n<h3>3. Clogged Toilet<\/h3>\n\n<p>Toilet blockage or stopping are the signs that it needs prompt service. Instead of flushing, usually, the water returns to the toilet bowl and overflows inside your bathroom. Clearing a blockage usually brings your drains or toilet back to normal with a little DIY work or a plumber trip.<\/p>\n\n<p>So, try to locate the cause behind the problem as slow or closed drains occur when something partially or completely blocks the drain. In sinks and showers, hair is often the culprit, but other objects such as the shampoo lid or toy can block the pipe from entering the drain. In the toilet, the problem often comes when something different than waste enters and flows into the bathroom. Those solids cannot pass through the pipe, so they keep pouring, making it difficult or impossible for water to flow and water flowing from the bottom of the tube.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try to identify and fix clogged drains and toilets with a plumber who works on both toilets and drains. A simple plumbing tool can help loosen clogs using air pressure. Place the open end of the plumber entirely on the pipe and rotate it up and down to suck. If you can attract enough blockages, grab the soil using tweezers or pliers and remove it from the drain. If you cannot remove the impediment with the rider, Chemical Drain Cleaner offers an additional option. Home improvement stores also deal in plumbing solutions that can remove obstructions to allow water to flow again.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>How To Avoid Clogging Drains And Toilets<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>Avoid toilet clogs by flushing only waste products from under the toilet. Keep children close by without flushing toys or other large objects under the toilet. If anything falls in the toilet, take it out without trying to flush it out. In the rain, use a hair catcher on the top of the drain so that loose strands do not collect inside the drain pipe. Try not to synchronize the loose strands of hair to avoid clogging.<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>When To Call A Plumber<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>If you cannot easily remove the obstruction, give a professional handle with a closed drain or clogged toilet. Another time to call a plumber is when you are repeatedly clogged in the same drain. Regular use of a caustic drain cleaner can damage the pipe over time. The plumber can fix the problem so that the tube does not get damaged and clogged in the future.<\/p>\n\n<h3>4. Low Water Pressure<\/h3>\n\n<p>Weak water pressure makes using any plumbing system in your home challenging as low water pressure is a symptom of major plumbing problems. It includes pipe corrosion, Leak water in your home, obstructing drainage, broken or blocked sewer lines inside your home plumbing system. In case of low water pressure, the problem in reaching water from one end to another end as you must maintain the fixed amount of water pressure by re-creating the plumbing system.<\/p>\n\n<h3>5. Pipe Leak<\/h3>\n\n<p>Leaking pipes can cause all sorts of problems that may occur due to stubborn cock, wrong piping, pipe corrosion, damage to the pipe joint, cracked seal or cracked pipe, high water pressure. No matter what the leaking pipe is, this simple pipeline problem needs to be fixed fast to avoid water logging inside your home. In the case where long-lasting drip pipes are ignored, they cause more damage to your pipeline system and your home.<\/p>\n\n<p>Try to find a licensed plumber in your local areas to find an uninterrupted service at your home comfort.

Here we have shared some most useful tips to consider during air conditioner service and maintenance","blog_name":"The Most Useful Air Conditioner Repair And Maintenance Tips You Can Do- Yourself","blog_keywords":"air conditioner repair","blog_content_text":"<p>It is essential to keep your air conditioner in well working condition for uninterrupted service in any season. The modernized air conditioning unit runs efficiently, uses less energy and is less expensive to operate. A properly serviced air conditioner system experiences fewer breakdowns and longer lifespan. As a homeowner, you may have to deal with some simple air conditioner maintenance tasks, but you should leave the technical evaluations and repairs to properly trained and licensed professionals. If you find it inconvenient to find any air conditioner items, never hesitate to call any trained professional. If you perform some self-maintenance, always take safety precautions and always lock the unit in your electrical box before doing any work on your outdoor unit.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maintenance and repair for your home air conditioning system is a daunting task, and rightly so. With all the components that make up various systems and subsystems, the modern AC unit attracts everyone with its machines, electronic components and chemicals. However, with a little knowledge, you can save yourself a bundle on service costs. No special equipment or necessary equipment is required for self-maintenance. In the most of the cases, the average equipment you have in your toolbox at home will fit, but you need to know your way around your AC system as different brands can vary significantly in the configuration. Most homes air conditioner systems are divided into two central units: an outdoor unit with a compressor and a condenser and an indoor unit with an evaporator coil.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Clean Or Replace The Air Filter<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Replacing your air conditioner&#39;s filter or cleaning it if you have a reusable filter is one of the most critical air conditioner maintenance tasks. Do this once a month during peak season and once in the fall and spring months. You can find air filters behind the return air grill on the wall or ceiling in the central living room of the house. When the filter is clogged with dust, dirt and allergens, airflow is reduced, and your system works harder than it should. The air flowing through your system can also affect the quality of your indoor air to those living in the home and trigger allergy and asthma symptoms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solution here: Install a high-quality air filter from inexpensive fiberglass air filters that do not capture small particles such as pollen, bacteria and virus and should be replaced once every 30 days. Resident filters can be found from a window unit air conditioner, which is considered suitable for residential use. If you have allergies and asthma problems, family members with pets, living in an infected area or other similar indoor air quality challenges, consider upgrading to a filter system that does more. The quality air filter can remove up to 99.98% of these airborne pollutants and has a reusable filter. Air conditioner filters may not be easy to install or clean, and any homeowner can do it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replacing your air filter is one of the most important things you can do to keep your AC system running properly. On average, you should change your filter once in a month. Depending on how often your AC unit is in use, you may be allowed to run it a little longer, but this is not recommended by any expert service technician. A dirty filter can disrupt airflow and put pressure on your whole system, which can significantly reduce the amount of cold air flowing into your home. It can also damage some internal air conditioner parts that affect the cooling. If the dust is not filtered correctly, it will travel to the parts of the indoor unit and tend to stick to them. Hiring a professional to remove dust wards from inside your unit is not only time consuming, but also very expensive.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Inspect Wiring And Components<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Internal connections to your air conditioner are essential for its operation. What you do not know about them can annoy your pocket with inefficient cooling, so it is vital to turn off the power of the condenser unit and check the wiring of the outdoor unit at least once a year with its accessibility. Remove the panel and look for signs of overheating - such as molten insulation on wires and black or burnt wire.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, make sure that any electrical connections are tight. If you have an electrical test meter, you can check the capacitor of the unit. If you notice any problems and are not comfortable fixing them yourself, call a local heating and air conditioning specialist to work for you. And if you are not comfortable checking these parts, that&#39;s fine! Ask your local HVAC experts to be included in your biennial inspection.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Call For Professional AC Maintenance<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Proper air conditioner maintenance will make you feel comfortable on the hottest days of summer.

Clogged Drains<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to daily usage, many of the drains, including the sink in the kitchen, get clogged due to blockage of materials in the pipelines. If not treated on time they may cause great damage to the drainage system<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Water Harm and Repairs<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the problem caused by old water leakages that are the main cause of the patches on kitchen and bathroom walls. They require a repair job.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Fitting<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Shifting into a new home, one of the major tasks is setting up the kitchen and washroom. This includes installing new taps and other items like a shower. These jobs don&#39;t require much of professionalism.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Installation<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This includes installing new water-related gadgets. E.g., Installing a geyser, RO, or water purifier. These kinds of problems are specially trained for the mentioned jobs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Accessing a trusted site<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While looking for services, finding a credible and reliable site is significant. Plumber service is a home job, so one has to be careful and alert. Finding out whether the service is recognized and the service provider sends you a certified trained plumber is very important.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the plumber details should be made available to you before he\/she visits you.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Pricing<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While most of the sites have the charges mentioned in the form of charges\/hour, it is very important to know approximately how much time your job would take.

Paying for a service<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Paying for your service is an important aspect of the job as one should always know the method of payment. Most of the services make payments through online payment portals, but some also support cash on delivery.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11. Reviews<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important and the last step for choosing an online plumbing service is reading the previous reviews from certified customers. Reviews reflect not only if the plumber&#39;s record is good; it also the amount of professionalism and legitimacy of the staff. Often in photo reviews, a problem similar to yours would be available that not only helps in understanding the problem but also tells the effort the job requires.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/book-ac-service-online-at-your-home\">Book AC Service Online At Your Home<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>No matter how small problems one encounters while dealing with water supply related issues, you should not underestimate the problem as sometimes even the smallest leaks become a cause of wall damps and ugly patches.

Know how to choose kitchen chimney","blog_name":"Kitchen Chimney- How To Choose The Best One","blog_keywords":"kitchen chimney","blog_content_text":"<p>A kitchen chimney is an important appliance that is designed to absorb fumes and smoke from the kitchen and keeps it smoke and oil-free. Moreover, the newest models of kitchen chimneys are known to add an aesthetic appeal and elegance to your modular kitchen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/kitchen-chimney-repair-service\">kitchen chimney<\/a> brand that you have decided to buy, you must take into consideration the suction power, filter, and the size of the same to make it blend with the size of your kitchen. When buying kitchen chimneys, here are some of the best guidelines to follow to get your hands on the best one.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Chimney Size Counts<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The kitchen chimney size largely depends upon the stove that you own. Some of the basic chimney sizes are 60 cm and 90 cm. If you own a stove with a minimum of two burners, you can choose a 60 cm chimney. However, if you happen to own a stove with more than 2 burners, then it is advisable to pick a chimney that is about 90 cm.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Style of Mounting<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The mounting style mainly depends upon the construction of your kitchen. For a cemented duct construction kitchen through the roof, always go for a ceiling-mounted kitchen chimney. But, always ensure that the shape of the chimney and the duct matches, for instance, if you own a round duct, then ensure that the kitchen chimney is equipped with a round pipe that serves as an exhaust. For a normal exhaust equipped kitchen, you can always choose a mounted chimney.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Consider the Capacity of Suction<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You would come across chimneys with multiple capacities of suction that ranges from 700m3\/hr to 1600 m3\/hr. Feel free to pick a suction capacity based on your style of cooking. If you happen to be a vegetarian who consumes less oil, then always opt for a suction capacity that varies between 800 to 1000. But if you happen to be a non-vegetarian, then go for a kitchen chimney that has a suction capacity below 1100. However, if you cook oily foods quite often, then your chimney must have the suction power of 1200.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Look for the Style of the Chimney<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian chimneys are available in two main options- one type comes with a straight glass and the other ones come with curved glass. But this decision is purely based on your preference. Although, it is always a good choice to pick a smart-looking chimney to add value and distinctive to your kitchen.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Installation of the Chimney Matters<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the kitchen chimney suppliers do not offer you the aluminium duct, installation followed by the end cap with the purchased kitchen chimney box, so you might have to invest in them separately. There are quite a few chimneys that have all of these included. So, always check the package thoroughly before bringing them home.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Check with the Service<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most factors that you must bear in mind when looking for a kitchen is the services promised by the seller. Do not for a kitchen chimney if it lacks to provide you with a promise for a good service. Always, run through the service details and if at all the manufacturer provides you with the same before ordering the chimney.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Look for Chimneys with Filterless Technology<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the present day, the chimneys are equipped with filterless technology. Chimneys that come with a filterless technology calls for lesser cleaning. They are often available with auto clean technology and oil collectors. They might be a little expensive than the basic chimneys, however, the service cost banishes the difference.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Check the Type of Filters Used<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The filters are used at all the stages of air handling inside a kitchen chimney and are classified into three major categories:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Cassette Filter<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Baffle Filter<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Carbon Filter<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The manufacturers always take the baffle filters to be the most perfect options for all Indian kitchens.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Decide the Types of Chimney<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you decide to invest in a kitchen chimney, you must always understand and think of the type that you want. The type of the kitchen depends upon the kitchen structure, cooking platform, and the hob location, and where you decide to fit it in. Depending upon the capabilities of where you want to install the kitchen chimneys, a kitchen chimney can be classified into 4 categories:<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Island Chimney- The island chimneys are installed on the ceiling right above the cooking hob.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Built-in Chimney- The built-in chimneys are installed inside the wooden furniture.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Wall-Mounted Chimney<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Corner Chimney-Corner chimneys are fitted in the kitchen corners where the stove is situated against the wall.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These were some of the best guidelines that you must look into and bear in mind when buying kitchen chimneys. These tips and guidelines would help you get the best chimney that is perfect for your kitchen and cooking style.<\/p>","blog_image":"drhe7jmannubhai_blog_banner4.webp","blog_image_cover":null,"blog_date":null,"update_time":"2022-01-28 15:36:17","status":"active","updated_at":"2022-01-28","created_at":"2020-07-29","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2020-07-29"},

The refrigerant is pumped into another coil outside the house, releasing its heat and liquefying it back. This outer coil is called a condenser because the cooling agent is a liquid that comes out of the gas like moisture chili in the house&#39;s window.

Here are the some reason when you should book washing machine services","blog_name":"When Should You Hire Service Engineer For Washing Machine Services","blog_keywords":"washing machine service","blog_content_text":"<p>Another essential gift of technology is the washing machine&mdash;one of the essential electronic products in the house. In recent days you will find a washing machine in most of the houses. It not only saves your time, but it saves your effort too. As it&#39;s an electronic product, obviously you will need to maintain it properly. For every electronic product, Maintenance is the prime thing you want to get a long term service. Unlike other machines, washing machines do not require monthly maintenance, but if anything happens with the machine, you need to call the service engineer to fix the machine properly. In this article, we have put together some of the common problems of washing machine for that you need to call the service engineer to fix the problems.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Time, When You Should Hire Service Engineer For Washing Machine Services&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1.&nbsp; When The Washer Won&#39;t Drain&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the common problems of the washing machine is the washer won&#39;t drain properly. It can be a serious issue. Do not neglect it; before it turns into a big issue, call the service person for washing machine service. This problem arises, especially when the pump or drain hose gets blocked with residual gunk, small pieces of clothes, or any other debris. Suppose the washer does not drain properly or doesn&rsquo;t spin correctly. Check with your product manual, or you can call the service center to lodge your complaint. The service center will send a service engineer to your place within 48 working hours; lastly, if the drainage pump is broken.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2.&nbsp; If The Washer Door Won&#39;t Unlock<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another common washing machine problem, mostly faced by the front loader. This is because the top-loader does not need to lock the door to keep the water locked like a front door. The front loader user needs to lock the door tightly until the washing is done. This can happen for a few reasons. Like if the lock mechanism jammed. Suppose there is a glitch in the washer&#39;s computer. If the washing machine does not drain properly and leaves the washer door remains to unlock, the drum is full of water. If you face these sorts of things, it&#39;s time for your washing machine service. Call the service engineer to get it done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.&nbsp; If Your Machine Makes Noise<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes objects get trapped in between the drum and the outer tub. This can create noise. Also, if your clothes contain coins, they will make it extreme noise. It can damage your machine. Make sure when you put your clothes inside the machine, check the pockets carefully. The bearing of the washing machine can be the reason for loud noise. With time the bearing starts to degrade. You can lubricate or can replace it. Call the professional service engineer to repair.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.&nbsp; Vibration During Operation<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason that you should call the engineer for washing machine service is vibration during operation. It&#39;s a common problem faced by most of the users. Keep your machine on a horizontal surface. If you cannot place is on the proper horizontal surface, then buy a stand to keep the machine.do not overload the machine. You may call the service center to and book your service.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.&nbsp; Problem During Drainage, Either Make Noise Or Cannot Drain Properly<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Suppose you find that the drainage system makes the problem check the drainage pump. The drain pump might get blocked due to dirt or clothes fiber accumulation. Clean the pump and also the connected hose. This might solve your problem. But it is recommended that hire a professional to do this. This requires professionalism.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6.&nbsp; Tripping The Power Of The Machine<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This problem can arise for many reasons. Might be there is an issue inside the motor. Might be there is a leak. It can happen that your motor overheats when you overload the machine. You can easily avoid the problem; what you have to do is do not overload it. But if you have multiple clothes to wash, you either buy a bigger machine with more capacity or wash your clothes in parts. If still the problem persists then call the service person&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7.&nbsp; Washing Machine Is Not Spinning<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the drainage and spinning system are connected internally. So if the drainage system is not working out, your machine will not spin properly. Check the pump filter, it might get blocked, or the hose can be blocked too. The motor capacitor can fail if the motor does not have the brushes. Another reason is if the belt from the motor has come out.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/book-air-conditioner-services-at-your-doorstep\">Book Air Conditioner Services At Your Doorstep<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>8.&nbsp; Water Leakage From The Soap Case<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It can happen for many reasons. Water pressure is strong; the drainpipe is blocked, over-filling, etc. You can get rid of this problem easily. Just call the technician for a washing machine service. Monthly or quarterly maintenance is not required, but if you see any of the above-mentioned issues, call your service engineer to get it done.<\/p>","blog_image":"oQJwblmannubhai_blogbanner2.webp","blog_image_cover":null,"blog_date":null,"update_time":"2022-01-27 12:59:05","status":"active","updated_at":"2022-01-27","created_at":"2020-09-04","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2020-09-04"},

Regular service and repair can ward off various occasional repair needs and emergencies arise in your air conditioner. Sometimes your inside heat is creeping up, and the air conditioner system is giving you trouble, and you cannot identify the source. You must have to look at these common air conditioner problems faced by most of the users. The reason behind the problem is the inefficiency of service and tune-ups or blocked filters.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>These common-looking air conditioner problems can make it even bigger and cause sudden breakdown and even burning&mdash;the most common way to keep your air conditioner even more long-lasting by providing regular service and tune-ups. Any delay after diagnosing these problems can hurt you much in different aspects, like adding more power or service bills. So, you can save the air conditioner from reaching these problems due to insufficiency in service, improper installation, and less cleaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Most Common Air Conditioning Problems<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Cleaning or Replacing The Existing Filter<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If your air conditioner is not producing cold air, check the filter first, because a dirty filter can hamper the airflow. You can also follow the manufacturer&#39;s instructions to clean the filter every three months as you can again reuse the filter for maximum time. So, if you see the dirty or clogged filter, immediately call the nearest AC service provider and make a contract for seasonal tune-ups.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Check The Thermostat Setting<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When your air conditioner is creating a starting problem, it will be wrongly settled. Check the condition of the thermostat interior in case of no sunlight interface. It might be okay after reinstalling the thermostat with the help of a well-experienced field service engineer.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Low Level Of Refrigerant Or Leak<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If your air conditioner temperature is fluctuating or unable to provide cooling, then your air conditioner may be experiencing a low level of gas. And the reason behind its low level indicates any leak in the Freon gas. Recharging your air conditioner with adding an optimum amount of refrigerant gas can help in achieving enough cooling. Any gas leakage depends upon the size and condition of the air conditioner installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. The compressor is one of the vital components as it regulates pressure and helps refrigerant to flow effortlessly. The dirty coils and refrigerant gas levels and capacitors will affect the compressor and make it faulty. If you are not getting cool air, then contact your service provider without making any delay. The service provider can make it workable or suggest to replace the compressor.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Evaporator coils<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Evaporator coil is an underrated air conditioner component but has a vital role in offering efficient cooling. Evaporator coils suck indoor heat and flow it back through the duct by lowering its temperature. The problem arises in the evaporator coil due to obstruction in the vent, dirty filter, or low Freon gas level inside the air conditioner. You can also make it clean by warm water and a mild detergent solution.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Condenser Coils<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Condenser is similar to evaporators and responsible for releasing inside heat as it is located outside the room. In the case of blockage happens in the condenser, it can be cleaned by water pressure. By cleaning twice or thrice a year can help in retaining it for more than your expectation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. The Exhausted Contractor<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhauster contractor works like an electrical switch to the air conditioner as it on-and-off after achieving the optimum cooling level. The worn-out exhaust, along with the compressor, blower motor, and condenser motor fan, is the top reason for sudden AC service.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, check the air conditioner power supply by following the external and internal wiring and then switch on the air conditioner. In case your air conditioner is not working as before, remove the outer filter and check the fan motor, whether it is working or not. In an air conditioner, several internal and external parts work together to make it work and offer optimum cooling. Still, due to less maintenance and service, it lowers capacity. You can help your air conditioner work smoothly by providing on-time service as it also increases its longevity.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It would be best to have your air conditioner run without a hitch when the summer starts. Even the best-conditioned air conditioner can also run into issues with continuous service. If your AC turns on but not blowing cold air, then check the vents and filters properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/when-should-you-hire-service-engineer-for-washing-machine-services\">When Should You Hire Service Engineer For Washing Machine Services<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>A fan is fitted inside the AC unit that blows the indoor air to the evaporator coil and makes it more relaxed than before. So, the whole thing depends on the air conditioner&#39;s service after running out as you can also save some of the regular AC service costs by self-cleaning or opting for long-term AC AMC plans.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Whole About Common Air Conditioner Problems<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A massive and complex electronic appliance air conditioner needs consistent care and cleaning to keep in good running shape. One can get a contract from a reputed AC service provider that offers your air conditioner constant and quality care. Read all the self-cleaning technologies along with instructions for timely service and maintenance. If you follow all the written instructions on time, you will surely get some extended year service. Trying a variable AC service center is quite risky because the technology available to cross the number of services can make your AC waste.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;<span class=\"marker\">About Author<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><span class=\"marker\">Basant Kumar<\/span>&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","blog_image":"QVQQBUmannubhai-blogbanner.webp","blog_image_cover":null,"blog_date":null,"update_time":"2022-01-27 12:56:46","status":"active","updated_at":"2022-01-27","created_at":"2020-09-15","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2020-09-15"},

For regular tune-ups and cleaning, purchase a long-term AC service plan all over India and give your air conditioner longevity. When you feel a strange activity in the AC system, it means there is a need for service as you have to contact your AC service provider. In this way, you can save a lot more than you are wasting on frequent AC service providers. So, here are the five most common problems in an air conditioner that need to be repaired quickly-<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Air Conditioner Blowing Warm Air Instead Of Cold Breeze<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>These types of cooling deficiency are caused by running for a more extended period without having any break as it can also increase the electricity bill. When you feel the warm breeze in cooling mode, then it needs immediate service to short out these difficulties. There are some other reasons may also be there like AC running out of refrigerant gas or any problem in the compressor system. A useful service or tune-up can short all these problems out, and you can get the desired cooling inside your space. In case of any ignorance in these situations can hurt you a lot at the time of the power bill.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>AC Vents Put Out Weak Airflow<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In this condition the can blow freely from the air registers and the air coming from AC vents is cold. Sometimes it is also the result of a clogged filter or leaky air ducts inside the air conditioner. This is not a complex problem as it requires just a few minutes to make it well in a cost-effective manner. You can also hire a mildly experienced service engineer to clean the clogged filter and repair the leaky ducts. These problems lead to foul smell inside your room because of the formation of molds colonies.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Air Conditioner Display Dramatic Air Swings<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If your air conditioner changes the temperature automatically without having any change in the outer environment. Sometimes this can happen due to the involvement of the direct sunlight. A periodic tune-up can short it out because it may be an insulation problem or non-air light windows. A trained service engineer can diagnose it properly and make it well after a few minutes of service. You can also check the gap between the AC unit and the wall and fill this insulation.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Irritating Sound From The AC Unit<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are using an air conditioner for a long time, then you can also be aware of the sound generated by an air conditioner at the time of cooling. You must be aware of the gentle sound then you can also feel the bizarre sound that may be generated because of service insufficiency. Schedule a tune-up process without having any delay because it may cost you much when it should be ignored for long-time.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/common-air-conditioner-problems\">Common Air Conditioner Problems<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>Re-check the sound just after the service ends and feel the difference in the previous and current sound. Once you start caring for your air conditioner regularly, then you must experience a relatively low-cost service in the near future&mdash;no matter which brands of air conditioner you are using in your home and office.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Foul Smell Due To Mold-Moisture Contents<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any smell and unpleasant odor from the air conditioner indicates the compressor leakage or disturbed drain tube. A regular tune-up can make these things well, and you will be exempted from the bad smell. Sometimes it can be due to the accumulation of molds and spores inside the air conditioner due to the excess humidity. The better you clean the air conditioner the better you get from your air conditioner as you have to care for it as well as an expensive appliance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>What Happens When You Don&#39;t Service Your AC For A Long Time?<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The service cost and overall energy consumption also depend upon the maintenance of your air conditioner. Every electric appliance needs regular maintenance and repair after a fixed time of interval. Therefore you don&#39;t have many service requirements in the initial one to two years after purchasing a new air conditioner system. Any air conditioner system is mainly composed of 5 significant constituents as follows-<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Compressor- compress the Freon gas, and the kinetic energy of the gas is increasing due to compression.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Condenser- the hot and pressurized gas is passed through a series of the coil and lowers the temperature of the air.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Receiver dryer-it works to dry the air by eliminating all the water molecules as its primary duty is to dry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Expansion valve-the valve offer required assistance as high-pressure liquid changes its state into low-pressure<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Evaporators- the low-pressure liquid flows through the blower motor pushes the air across the tubes.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Last Words About The Five Common Problems In The AC<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>These types of signs and symptoms indicate anything abnormal happens in your air conditioner as you need to schedule a service engineer for its removal. If you schedule a tune-up before these hiccups then will retain most of the efficiency lost due to the inefficiency of service. A trained service engineer will diagnose these problems and do the needful to fix it and stay away from expensive repairs. This is also advised that you can also do some self-cleaning exercises to make your air conditioner back in shape. The way you care about your air conditioner, well it can offer you an extended years&#39; service. In the case of ignorance, these five mistakes can make up to ten as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h3><span class=\"marker\">About Author<\/span><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><span class=\"marker\">Basant Kumar&nbsp;<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<\/blockquote>","blog_image":"VotzXamannubhai-blog-banner3.webp","blog_image_cover":null,"blog_date":null,"update_time":"2022-01-27 12:54:15","status":"active","updated_at":"2022-01-27","created_at":"2020-09-16","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2020-09-16"},

Problem & Solution","blog_description":"air conditioner not working? No issues read this to resolve your air conditioner common issues.","blog_name":"Air Conditioner Not working? Problem & Solution","blog_keywords":"air conditioner not working","blog_content_text":"<p>An air conditioner that isn&rsquo;t cooling appropriately is a foremost problematic situation, predominantly in the burning summer months. It can discomfort your house, and if it&rsquo;s hot enough, even necessitate you to spend the night elsewhere. It&rsquo;s vital to properly sustain your air conditioning system with washing, air filter altering, examinations, and other essential maintenance, but even the best-sustained units will sometimes go awry. Read on to find out what the utmost ordinary air conditioner problems are and how you can solve them.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: Air Isn&rsquo;t Coming Out Of The Registers<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: If no air is coming out, the fan on the outside unit may not be running. Believe it or not, this is an easy problem you want to have, as it typically means that the breaker is trip up and needs to be reset. Or you may have added stress-free problem: the blower belt, which will need to be replaced. Other causes include an issue with your thermostat. Your condensate pump reservoir may be filled as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: Your Air Conditioner Isn&rsquo;t Switching On At All<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: An air conditioner that won&#39;t switch on may indicate a problem with the thermostat. Adjust your thermostat to cold temperature and smash down the temperature setting, then cross-check your electrical panel for a tripped breaker or a fuse blown. Check for problems with power supply by viewing at wires. You can also look at your furnace power switch and thermostat for any issues.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: The Air Conditioner Isn&rsquo;t Effectual In Cooling<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: An air conditioner running but isn&#39;t cooling is one of the most common problems. Unfortunately, it has a number of potential causes. It can be an unclean air filter, decreased refrigerant level, or a clogged condensate drain. You can also look for ice around the coils or a dirty outdoor compressor. Or, you may need to add more coolant to your system. Another problem: it may solely be too hot outdoor to cool your home to your liking. Most air conditioners can only cool to about 20 degrees lesser than external air temperatures.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: Your Air Conditioner Is Propelling Hot Air<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: An air conditioner that is blowing hot air can be infuriating. Repeatedly, the issue is with an unclean air filter, as this can be the source flow problems. Authenticate that the external unit is running, and check to see if there are leaves or other debris barricading airflow. Another issue may be that you decrease on refrigerant.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: The Circuit Is Leaking<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: Air conditioning units create condensation, which is characteristically drained correctly. But occasionally, pipes can form seepage or be chocked, or the condensate pump may discontinue working. Try clearing your condensation drain pipe, clear the pump system of algae with a bleach solution, check to ensure the electrical connection to the condensate pump, replace the pump, and check your condensation drain pipe leaks.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: The Compressor Won&rsquo;t Run<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: A compressor that won&#39;t run could indicate a burned wire, defective start capacitor, or only a defective compressor. You should regulate your refrigerant charge, unsoiled the condenser coil, double-check the capacitor, and substitute the compressor if it doesn&#39;t reset.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: The Air Conditioner Is Not Turning Off<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: Even&nbsp;burning outdoor, your air conditioner should turn off sometimes. An air conditioner that runs uninterruptedly can direct an issue with the fan. Turn the thermostat fan to the off point to see if you can stopover it that way. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to check refrigerant levels and transmit switches.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: The Air Conditioner Is Making An Outlandish Sound<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: Air conditioners make noise, but sometimes, they&rsquo;ll make a noise you don&rsquo;t recognize, and that can specify an issue. Strange noises may be a mystery, but a noisy air conditioner is often a belt problem, particularly if it&#39;s making a shrieking sound. The belt may be inappropriately aligned or need replacing. An oppressive noise typically shows a problem with the motor&rsquo;s bearings. Pinging or rattling noises may indicate that you need to stiffen cover panels.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Problem: The Unit Turns On And Off Constantly<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Solution: An air conditioner that comes on and off again several times continually is prompting an indication of an issue. Most likely, your condenser unit is dirty or blocked, and you may also have an unclean evaporator.

A refrigerator is one of those electric appliances that run without any break, so keeping it in the best shape is particularly important.

Proper care can minimize wear and tear to the refrigerator and help you to avoid common refrigerator issues that can surely raise its lifespan. Here are some do-it-yourself fridge maintenance tips that you can practice at your home as well.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some Tips For Refrigerator Service<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>#1. Remove Dust And Debris When Clean The Coils<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You cannot be able to see the coils of the refrigerator but keeping it dust and debris free helps it to operate effortlessly and efficiently. The coils are either located at the bottom or back of the unit. You don&#39;t need to remove a grill to wipe it off; you just need to remove a few simple screws and make it clean. If your unit&#39;s coils are located in the back of the unit, you may have to move the unit away from the wall that gives you the required space to clean the floor under the refrigerator. You can also keep a self-coil cleaning tool to get the job done; you can also use a vacuum cleaner in its absence. Just roll the vacuum cleaner or brush around the coils and remove all the dust and clean the condenser fan along. The refrigerator coils must be cleaned once or twice a year and more often if it is required.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#2. Maintain The Refrigerator Temperature Constant<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Check the refrigerator temperature more often, along with the freezer sections of your unit. Maintaining the temperature is vital for food safety as well as for helping the fridge run more efficiently. The fridge compartment should not lower than 40 degrees Fahrenheit and the freezer division must be at zero degrees Fahrenheit or lower. If you have an older model and its performance is gradually lowering, you can purchase a refrigerator thermometer to monitor its actual cooling.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#3. Need Regular Monitor To Save The Gasket<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If your gasket isn&#39;t properly sealing and cold air passes through the refrigerator unit, it needs to work harder and use more energy to maintain the ideal inside temperature. That&#39;s why you need to inspect the gasket more often and don&#39;t wait for any signs of wear and tear. If the gasket is cracked or spoiled, you must replace it to avoid further refrigerator problems. This practice is a part of your fridge maintenance, and make sure to clean the gasket time-to-time with warm, soapy water to help prevent harming the seal.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#4. Note The Time To Change The Filters<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people don&#39;t realize that refrigerators also have filters that need to be changed on time. Check the manufacturer&#39;s instructions carefully to get exact replacement information for your refrigerator model. Replacing the filter before its due date will help your freeze clean and will help all other components to work efficiently. A hassle-free way to remember to change your fridge filters is to do it yourself when it shows some signs and symptoms.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#5. Do Not Keep The Door Open<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping the refrigerator doors closed is one of the best ways to ensure refrigerators life and help to maintain the temperature. The refrigerator needs to work hard to retain the correct temperatures when the door is opened unnecessarily. Retrieve all the items at once before you close the refrigerator door open, and make sure the door is closed tightly when you are shutting it.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#6. Install Your Refrigerator In Level<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If your refrigerator is not fixed at the proper level, the doors may not close properly, or the seal is not working right, along with the motor. Use a level tool or put the refrigerator on shelves to check its correct position. Need to adjust the feet of the refrigerator on a plain to keep the unit even on all sides.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#7. Don&#39;t Forget To Cover Food Items<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Store food properly in an airtight container with tight-fitting tops, or cover with foil paper or plastic wrap to avoid spoilage. This proper packing will help to minimize the entry of moisture into the refrigerator.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#8. Fill It Properly To Get Better Cooling<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>People don&#39;t want to overcrowd the refrigerator or freezer, but keeping it full will actually help the unit to achieve better cooling and function more competently. At the time of filling the refrigerator and freezer, be careful not to block any vents or doors.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#9. Defrost The Freezer When It Requires<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wish to run your freezer more efficiently and taste better from your drinks, then defrost your freezer more often. The ice at the top of the freezer melted while the ice on the bottom just sits there for long periods and forms a hard surface. Empty the entire freezer periodically and refill it from the bottom to make sure all the ice melts properly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#10. Keeping The Fridge Lights On<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not think that the light bulbs don&#39;t have any role in the fridge, but it will make a big difference keeping the door open longer.

Check the interior light bulbs that are burning out promptly so that you don&#39;t fumble in searching anything around in dark shelves and drawers.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let The Food Cool Down Before Placing In The Refrigerator<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Placing hot food in your fridge will raise the unit&#39;s temperature and make it harder to work hard to maintain the temperature. Let the hot food items cool down properly before storing them in the refrigerator so that they don&#39;t disturb the internal temperature.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Choose The Appropriate Place To Place The Refrigerator<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose an appropriate place to install the refrigerator, and it must be away from the cooktop, oven, or any other heating appliances. If your refrigerator is next to any heat-generating items, it needs to work harder to keep the matter cold and use more energy in the cooling. Make sure that it has enough space around the refrigerator and allow the vents to function properly. Make enough space from the cabinets or other appliances to give it the freedom to exhaust it properly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you are offering regular refrigerator preventative maintenance, you also need to care about the warning signs that may lead to a broken refrigerator and as-.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Food and beverages aren&#39;t as cold as they normally are<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Melted ice cream<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Ice cubes are stuck together<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Food and drinks start spoiling before the due date<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Water spillage around the unit<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Unusual noises and blizzard sounds<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you notice all these signs, this is the time to call a qualified refrigerator service professional for immediate help.

How Can You Maintain Your Refrigerator well?<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This article will provide you with a brief idea of the steps you need to follow to maintain your fridge.

Set the Right Temperature<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like setting the right temperature for your AC is important for its proper functioning, you need to do the same thing here. Setting the right temperature for your fridge prevents the machine from becoming overburdened.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also conserves energy and, therefore, reduces your electricity bills. 37 to 40 ? is more or less the perfect temperature that is needed for your fridge. However, the freezer should be kept at 5 ?, which is the optimal freezing temperature. This will ensure that the food remains fresh and your fridge works fine too.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#3. Try to Keep Your Fridge Full<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although we might think that keeping the fridge completely full overburdens the fridge, it is not so. Rather keeping it well stocked is good for your refrigerator. The reason behind this is that if there are lots of empty spaces in your fridge, the compressor will have to work harder to cool these spots. Thus it will consume more energy and won&rsquo;t be cost-efficient. If you face any major problems, you can also reach out to any of the best refrigerator repair in Faridabad.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#4. Check the Condenser Coils<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Condenser coils play a major role in cooling the insides of your fridge properly.

They will make sure you have a suitable condenser coil for your model.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#5. Do Not Open the Door of Your Fridge Unnecessarily<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of us have a habit of opening the fridge door frequently to take out things. At times we also forget to close them properly after our work is done. Because of these acts, warm air from outside enters our fridge and overburdens the condenser to cool down the insides again and again. If proper care is not taken, it can lead to the breakdown of the machine. So always try to take things out of the refrigerator, all at once. You need to ensure that the fridge door is properly closed after you finish taking out your food items.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#6. Keep Your Food Covered<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever you keep some leftover food items in your fridge, make sure that you store the food in an airtight container. This will help you to retain the moisture content of your food. In fact, it will also prevent the compressor from overworking by removing the moisture from your food and cooling them. Moreover, this can also reduce your electricity bills. There are many reputed refrigerator repair in Faridabad where the technicians will advise you the same thing.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#7. Place your fridge in the Right location<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this might seem unimportant, placing your fridge in the right location is essential for its proper functioning. Whenever you purchase a refrigerator, always make sure that you place it away from sunlight or any hot areas. It is also advisable by the technicians that you place it at least 15cm away from the wall. This will make the condenser function properly.

Besides these, for solving the problem, you should know the exact root causes of problems.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fixing the problem does not mean unplugging or re-plugging the switch. You need to contact the buyer for the particular refrigerator issue. In addition to it, here is a list of some of the most common problems with the refrigerator.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water leakage&nbsp;This problem can be tricky if someone falls on the floor because of this water leakage. There are two major causes of this significant problem. The first and foremost reason is the defrost drain. You can look to the back wall of the freezer to check the defrost drain. Debris can be the reason for water leaking in the defrost drain.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of a long and thin pipe, you can work on removing the clog. On the other hand, the second reason is the frozen water supply. It does not only lead to water leakage but also to the puddle under the fridge.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#1. It Is Not Cold Enough<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, you may observe that your refrigerator is not cool enough. Due to it, most of your items which are kept in fridge ruins and frozen items are not getting too much-frozen effect. However, this problem is not cumbersome to resolve. All you need to do is look for the back wall of the freezer, whether it is cold or not.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, it was cold then I heard the sound of the evaporator fan running. If you did not attend to the sound, there is some issue with the freezer evaporator fan. In the second case, if you listen to the sound, then check for their compressor. Clean this part of the refrigerator.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#2. The Ice Maker Is Not Working<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also another problem that you may experience in your refrigerator. It indicates that the ice maker motor requires replacement. In addition to it, another reason can be clogged water. Look for the screen, either it is plugged with debris or not.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to it, the problem in the ice-making mechanism is also another problem to look for. All you need to do is call the pro or experts to resolve the problem with the ice maker.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#3. Noise In Refrigerator&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, the refrigerator does not create too much noise daily. If you suddenly observe the noise in your refrigerator, then it may cause trouble with the fan. The majority of refrigerators consist of the condenser fan and evaporator fan. The working time of both of these fans is the same. Due to it, the refrigerator can be loud.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/tips-and-tricks-to-maintain-a-refrigerator\">Tips and Tricks to Maintain a Refrigerator<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>Either it is the condenser fan or evaporating fun; if one of them has a problem, it leads to noise. All you need to do is call the buyer and discuss all the issues. Further, a service member will come to your home and resolve this problem.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#4. High Electricity Consumption&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As per the BEE ratings, the fridge consumes electricity. It is recommendable to look for the five stars ratings while purchasing. It leaves to the highly energy-efficient appliance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you compare the older model with the modern one, you may find older ones consume high electricity compared to the new one. You can solve this problem by replacing the older one with a modern one.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#5. Warm Refrigerator&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary purpose of the refrigerator is for cooling and keeps the food that is placed in it fresh. If you observe the heat in your refrigerator, then you should consider the cause of this. To get rid of this problem, you should work on cleaning the condenser coil.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are still facing a problem, you should look for the condenser fan motor to ensure the perfect condition.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#6. The Door Does Not Shut<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is another most common problem that is usually observed in the refrigerator. The primary reason is that the strip which is fruitful in sealing the refrigerator door wears out. Moreover, it is not difficult to replace.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, if you think that it is a cup of your tea, then continue; otherwise, call a pro. Most of the time, older refrigerators face this issue.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, these are some most common problems that are easy to fix. All you need to do is get the appropriate guidance on the exact issue of your refrigerator. Due to it, you will find the precise solution to this problem.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","blog_image":"SvMCdZmannubhai_blogbanner7,.webp","blog_image_cover":null,"blog_date":null,"update_time":"2022-01-25 16:31:39","status":"active","updated_at":"2022-01-25","created_at":"2021-07-20","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2021-07-20"},

Usually, low water yielding, annoying noise, unpleasant odor in water are the most common signs that your water purifier shows asking for services. However, the water purifier expert advises&nbsp;that a water purifier should get proper treatment at a regular and periodic time interval of 3 months.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge Indian population is unaware of the fact that regular and periodic water purifier service makes the device efficient and long-lasting. In our society people only hire a technician to get their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/water-purifier-service\">water purifier service<\/a> done when the device completely stops bringing clean water. The main reason behind it is unawareness of the fact that when should one get their water purifier service done.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this post we&rsquo;ll be discussing the right time to get your water purifier service done so if you face the same problem and are unaware about &ldquo;how I know if my water purifier needs service&rdquo; then read this post till the end and get your doubt clear. But before we start exploring our main topic let&rsquo;s discuss the importance of getting regular water purifier service.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Importance Of Timely RO Service<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>On-time water purifier service offers you a nonstop supply of pure water<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Timely service adds life to the water purifier and their filters<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Scheduled maintenance keeps your water purifier maintenance cost in control<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Regular service prevents early breakdown and frequent repairs<\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to know the cause behind the water purifier before diving into its detailed service and maintenance. You have to consider the right time to schedule preventive management that includes the current condition of the consumables. There are few majors that may affect the water purifier performance-<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp; The level of impurities suspended in the raw water<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp; TDS level of water and the hardness<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp; The exact amount of water to be purified<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp; The frequency of preventive maintenance<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filters and membranes are the most vital parts of any water purifier that includes sediment, carbon, and other filters. The standard time to replace the filters and membranes of a water purifier is around 6-8 months or the frequency of use. You have to diagnose the current condition of these constituents inside your water purifier.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read-&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/why-is-ro-water-purifier-service-important\">Why Is RO Water Purifier Service Important?<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Check The Condition Of Sediment Filter<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A sediment filter is used to cut out dirt and soil particles from raw water as the primary filter, the sediment filter also has a key role in maintaining and protecting the other membranes. When you overlook changing the filter at the suggested time, the dirt penetrates the sediment filter and pollutes the purified water. An out of order sediment filter can lead to various health conditions.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t Forget To Diagnose The Carbon Filter<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The polluted water is blackish and carries a bad smell which makes it unfit for direct consumption. In the case of municipal water, chlorine is added to purify water before supplying it to your homes. The chlorine can purify polluted water to a certain level, but it leaves a smell in the water. Here comes the role of carbon filters to remove chlorine and other chemical traces present in water. This is why it is vital to change the carbon filter at least once a year to remove odors effectively.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Follow The Standard Schedule To Change The Filter And RO Membrane<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Serial no<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Type of filter and membrane<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Duration of usage<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Sediment filter<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>12 months<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>2<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Carbon filter<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>12 months<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>3<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>RO membrane<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t\t<td>\r\n\t\t\t<p>1-2 years<\/p>\r\n\t\t\t<\/td>\r\n\t\t<\/tr>\r\n\t<\/tbody>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\n<p>In the process to decontaminate the water to make it drinkable as it carries an excess of minerals and salts. These elements can induce severe health conditions if they are not eliminated before consuming. Water either uses filtration, sedimentation, and distillation to remove physical and chemical pollutants.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the water purifiers need to be serviced in 3-6 months as you can experience some abnormalities in your water purifier when it exceeds more than 12 months.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Different Types Of Water Purifier Needs Specific Service Requirements<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>#1. RO Water Purifier<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>RO uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove dissolved solids as chlorine, nitrates, and sulfates from polluted water. To keep your RO system in tip-top condition, it needs to be cleaned once every 12 months. After cleaning thoroughly, drain out water from the tank and insert the required filters and membranes. You must avoid immediate water consumption after service as it is good to throw out at least 1 tank of water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#2. UV Water Purifier Maintenance Tips<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In case of UV water purifier maintenance, the UV lamp must be exchanged after 12 months if you wish to remove microbes, bacteria, pathogens, and viruses successfully. Normal cleaning can be good enough to flush out the killed germs and make it durable for extended use.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#3. Ultrafiltration Water Purifier<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>When the water goes through the UF membrane, it eradicates solids, and viruses like the RO water purifier does. The hollow fiber membrane of the UF filter separates pollutants from raw water by a particularly larger membrane than RO that works well up to one year.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#4. Don&rsquo;t Overlook The Drips And Water Leakages<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are tired of experiencing drips in your water purifier, get in touch with an expert technician to schedule a doorstep check-up. Make sure the leaks are properly sealed to neglect the kind of leakage and drip in the near future.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#5. One Can Buy An AMC Plan<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Annual maintenance contracts make it easier to maintain a water purifier better than before at the lowest cost possible. There are a lot of RO AMC plans available online that make it easy to maintain your water purifier&rsquo;s original efficiency and produce minimum hassles.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#6. Know-How Long Your Water Purifier Lasts<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You should know the exact life cycle of the water filters as sediment as pre-filter, carbon pre-filter, RO membrane, and the activated carbon as the post filter. Each of the membrane and filters needs to be either cleaned or replaced to keep the continuous flow of pure water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, these filters have a limited life span; it majorly depends upon the usage and type of water. When your water remains under service, it appears some signals that indicate it needs service. If you are facing a problem with the taste, color, and your RO system keeps working the whole day but can&#39;t fill the tank.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#7. The Problem With The Water Pressure<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The low water pressure in the sign of the under service as the filter needs to be cleaned or replaced to bring back the original water flow. The water purifier finds it hard to purify water when its filters are clogged and produce low water pressure.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#8. Altered water taste<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Noticing any bad taste in water is the sure-shot sign of the filter problem as it needs to be exchanged promptly. You can either experience a taste of chlorine, soil, and others that is a result of improper water filtration.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>#9. The Continuously Running Water Purifier<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A water purifier is a non-stop working machine, but once the water storage tank fills completely, it stops automatically. Your water purifier finds it hard to fill the tank when there is a problem with water flow, or it&#39;s getting insufficient water inlet. A continuously running water purifier system needs to be checked and resolved to get the best outcomes from your water purifier.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Summarizing<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A water purifier generally has 5-7 filters to achieve the kind of purity and eliminate diverse pollutants. Apart from cleaning and sanitizing, and changing the filter on a regular basis, you can also think about installing a water softener to extend the water purifier&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Never ignore checking the water purifier when you notice any decline in water purifier performance to get free access to odorless and healthy water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>@7065012902 call and hire a professional service engineer at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/\">Mannu Bhai<\/a>.

There is no secret to making these things pure and pollution-free. We human beings are one of the prime reasons behind the deterioration of water. Surface water bodies are turned into drainage because of the uncontrolled dumping of toxic wastes. Because of the pollution in water, tap water also needs to be purified before consumption.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason why people need a water purifier is to remove all kinds of biological, chemical and physical pollutants. The water purifier has different types of filters and membranes to eliminate all sorts of suspended impurities. The RO water purifier can eliminate smaller than 10 microns particles that are the reason why it needs frequent service and repair.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The frequency of RO service depends on the quantity and quality of pollutants that must be eliminated. A water quality test is the best way to get your best-matched water purifier. The water purifier expert suggests a water purifier on the basis of the presence of suspended pollutants.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types Of Water Purifier And Its Frequent Service Needs<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding every water purifier is really tough as it is important to go through the generally used water purifiers. The water quality expert suggests you RO, UV, and UF water purifiers depending on the tap water quality.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. <strong>Reverse Osmosis (RO)<\/strong> - Reverse osmosis system ideal option in case of having high TDS levels. RO water purifier effectively removes excess salts and heavy metals, and other toxins from water. TDS controller is also used along with the RO technology to prevent eliminating essential minerals from water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. <strong>UV water purifier (UV)<\/strong> &ndash; it is a UV lamp powered water purifier to disinfect water by removing suspended pollutants. The UV water purifier effectively works on all water sources, whether you are purifying tap or municipally supplied water. The exact amount of pollutants present in water is diagnosed at a water testing laboratory.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. <strong>UF water purifier (UF)<\/strong> &ndash; ultrafiltration is a fine membrane that can eliminate minute pollutants of less than 10 microns. Sometimes it is a gravity-based UF water purifier that doesn&#39;t need any external power source to operate. Gravity based water purifier works well where there is a low water TDS level.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What Type Of Pollutants Present In The Raw Water?<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a diverse range of pollutants that may be present in water that including physical, chemical, and biological. Further, it can categorize into bacteria, nitrates, pesticides, and excess salts are some of the commonly found scums. To extract the exact kinds of pollutants, you can go for a laboratory water quality test.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your tap water contains a high amount of contaminants and microbes, choose the RO+UV+UF water purifier. The UV membrane penetrates the cells of bacteria and stops the multiplication, as the RO membrane traps the dead cells and other biological pollutants. So, when you use the following water filters in a single water purifier, it gives you 100% pure and disease-free water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Need Of Timely RO Service And Maintenance<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Reverse Osmosis, known as RO, is the most commonly used water purification technique used for household purposes. The RO is a special kind of water filtration technology in which water is deionized by pushing it under pressure using a semi-permeable membrane. The water then moves from the more concerted side to the less concerted side to offer pure drinking water.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The clean water is known as permeate, and the leftover is known as a brine that can be used for other household purposes. The RO membranes play a central role in the water purification process; that&rsquo;s why it needs timely replacement of RO filters and membranes when it is not serviced on time. To improve the productivity of your RO water purifier, regular servicing and repair are essential.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>A RO filter is like the heart of the RO water purifier that filters out suspended wastes from the raw water and ensures only the cleanest and safest drinking water for you. With continuous use, physical and biological contaminants clog the filter, damaging the filter permanently.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<h3>Also Read- <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/blog\/why-is-ro-water-purifier-service-important\">Why Is RO Water Purifier Service Important<\/a><\/h3>\r\n\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p>The other filters and carbon-based filters also lose their penetrable properties with respect to time and need regular replacement. That&rsquo;s why it needs to maintain the RO membrane and needs to replace the RO filter on time or before the due date.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How Often Can The RO Filters Be Serviced Or Replaced?<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The pre-filter RO, installed outside the RO water purifier, must be changed within six months; further, it depends on the quality and quality of water purified per hour. The most commonly used pre-filters such as DI cartridge activated carbon and sediment filter should be replaced within 6 to 12 months. The frequency of how many liters of water passes through the RO membrane, but it decided only the filter should be inspected thoroughly.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep your RO membrane safe and working properly, it is mandatory to change the RO filters within 1 year. Apart from filters, the RO membrane needs to be replaced every 2 years. If RO service is not scheduled before the due date, the pollutants and chemicals may be found in your drinking water because of the inability of the RO membrane, which can be injurious to health.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Summary About The Need Of RO Service<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The above information is helpful for every RO user.

Professional technicians ensure thorough cleaning of the air filters, gaps, and nozzles in the right way.","blog_name":"Air Conditioner Noise Reduction Techniques for a Quieter Home","blog_keywords":"air conditioner repair","blog_content_text":"<p>In this scorching summer heat, the last thing you want to put your mind to is the condition of your AC. Air conditioners hold massive power to calm the ambiance of a living space. But if it is making loud and strange sounds throughout the time you are using it, it is challenging to cherish the advantages of your air conditioner. The good news is that you can now use some tactful ways to reduce the humming or hissing sound. With the help of the following tactics, you can not only keep your AC sound but also keep it running in a good condition.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Pick a Comparatively Quieter AC Unit<\/h3>\r\n<p>When buying a new AC unit, you must take into account the noise rating. You can look up models with a specific design for quiet operation. Modern units generally come with noise-cutting features like vibration-absorbing components, insulated compressor elements, and more. If you are still deciding whether to choose an AC unit based on your specific needs, get in touch with HVAC experts. They can help you find the ideal AC system according to your requirements.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Appropriate Isolation and Placement<\/h3>\r\n<p>The place where your AC unit is installed plays a significant role in reducing the noise. It is vital to establish your air-conditioner far from your living space and mainly your bedroom. It is best to avoid installing them in areas where the level of sensitivity is high. One can use foam or rubber pads under the unit to trap the vibration and cease it from going through the walls or floors.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Daily Maintenance of your AC Unit<\/h3>\r\n<p>A properly maintained air-conditioning system is the best solution to cherish quiet air-cooling technology. Professional technicians ensure thorough cleaning of the air filters, gaps, and nozzles in the right way. AC Maintenance experts can look for moulds and oil-moving sections within the unit. Sometimes, loose connections are one of the common reasons for noise caused due to friction with the AC. They can also detect any loose connections with the AC unit and fix them to prevent unnecessary glitches.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Clean or Replace your Air Filters<\/h3>\r\n<p>Clogged AC filters are another reason AC units tend to make noises. Blocked filters in your air conditioner unit often make your overall system and mechanism work harder than usual. Replacing or simply cleaning your air filter once in a while can ensure adequate airflow. However, the air filter cleaning and replacement techniques and timings vary per every AC model. Therefore, you can seek assistance from the manufacturer's recommended guidelines to follow the perfect air filter replacement schedule.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Invest In a Sound Blanket<\/h3>\r\n<p>If you have already been experiencing noises from your AC, you must explore the benefits of sound blankets. These blankets are an excellent way to stifle the hissing sound coming out of your AC unit. There are many air conditioner companies that design sound blankets especially to match the model or making of a particular air conditioner. When you search online, you will find ample options available. Therefore, it is best to follow the recommendations made by the experts to choose the right blanket for your AC.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Install a Plywood Fence around Your Unit<\/h3>\r\n<p>If you last replaced your unit a while ago and it has turned old or worn out, your AC might have started to make noise. Installing a thin fence around your AC can create a barrier to the sound between your AC unit and you. This barrier often helps in muffling the noise coming out of your AC. One can install a fence of three feet height and simultaneously 3 feet spacing on all sides. One of the best materials to build the fence is plywood. Plywood fences are affordable and are a great way to examine if it is going to be a proper solution to noise reduction. If it works, you are suitable to install a permanent one around your air conditioner unit.<\/p>\r\n<p>It is also imperative to note that maintaining a 3 feet gap around your unit perimeter is essential. Confining the AC unit too tightly can overheat the unit. This can cause serious damage to your air conditioner's functionality and ruin your home&rsquo;s cooling capacity.<\/p>\r\n<h3>Clean Up the AC Fan Blades<\/h3>\r\n<p>If the motor of the condenser is not the source of the sound, there are some basic AC maintenance tips you can follow. Simple building of debris and dust on the fan blades can reduce the efficiency and power of your air conditioner. Not only that, it can also create a certain sound that might disrupt your sound sleep. One of the best tools for cleaning your fan blades and AC is the vacuum. It would help if you also remembered that the perfect time to replace your AC unit air filters is while you tend the blades. It is wise to consult reputed AC cleaning and maintenance professionals for a comprehensive AC maintenance service. RO Care can be your trusted cleaning partner to provide your air conditioner with the solution it needs this summer.<\/p>","blog_image":"AC-Maintenance.jpg","blog_image_cover":"AC-Maintenance.jpg","blog_date":null,"update_time":"2023-12-15 15:43:28","status":"active","updated_at":"2023-12-15","created_at":"2023-12-15","Canonical":null,"Robots":null,"author_name":"ADMIN","image3":null,"ckeditercontant":null,"publishdate":"2020-07-21"},

Each path comes with its own set of advantages and challenges, influencing the trajectory of your business journey. Let&rsquo;s delve into why taking a franchise might be the right move for some aspiring entrepreneurs, despite the allure of starting from scratch.<br \/><br \/><strong>1. Established Brand Recognition:&nbsp;<br \/><\/strong>One of the most significant benefits of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/franchise-opportunities\">opting for a franchise<\/a> is tapping into an established brand with a loyal customer base. This instant recognition can significantly reduce the time and resources needed to build brand awareness, giving franchisees a head start in the competitive market.<br \/><br \/><strong>2. Proven Business Model:&nbsp;<br \/><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/franchise-opportunities\">Franchises offer<\/a> a tested and proven business model, complete with operational systems, marketing strategies, and training programs. This mitigates much of the risk associated with starting a new venture, as franchisees can rely on a blueprint for success honed through years of experience.<br \/><br \/><strong>3. Ongoing Support and Training:&nbsp;<br \/><\/strong>Franchise agreements typically come with ongoing support and training from the franchisor. This invaluable assistance can range from site selection guidance to marketing assistance, providing franchisees with a safety net as they navigate the challenges of business ownership.<br \/><br \/><strong>4. Higher Success Rates:&nbsp;<\/strong>Statistics show that franchises generally have higher success rates than independent startups. This can be attributed to the combination of brand recognition, proven systems, and ongoing support, which collectively contribute to a greater likelihood of profitability.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:<\/strong><br \/>While <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/franchise-opportunities\">starting a franchise<\/a> may not offer the same level of creative freedom as launching an independent startup, the benefits of brand recognition, proven business models, and ongoing support make it an attractive option for many entrepreneurs.

While both offer lucrative opportunities for entrepreneurs, service franchises hold a distinct edge over their product-based counterparts.<\/p>\n<p>Firstly, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/franchise-opportunities\">service franchises<\/a> <\/strong>typically require lower initial investment compared to product franchises. With service-based businesses, overhead costs such as inventory and storage are significantly reduced or even eliminated altogether. This makes service franchises more accessible to a wider range of individuals, including those with limited capital to invest.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, service franchises often boast higher profit margins. Unlike product franchises, which may face fluctuating costs due to manufacturing, shipping, and storage, service franchises rely primarily on skilled labor and expertise. This allows for greater control over pricing and profit margins, resulting in potentially higher returns on investment.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/franchise-opportunities\"><strong>service franchises<\/strong><\/a> offer greater flexibility and scalability. They can easily adapt to changing market demands and trends without the need for extensive retooling or inventory management. Additionally, service-based businesses can expand their offerings and reach by diversifying their services or targeting new demographics.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, service franchises tend to foster stronger customer relationships and brand loyalty. By providing personalized and specialized services, they can create memorable experiences that keep customers coming back for more.<\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, while product franchises certainly have their merits, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mannubhai.com\/franchise-opportunities\">service franchises<\/a> offer distinct advantages in terms of affordability, profitability, flexibility, and customer engagement.
